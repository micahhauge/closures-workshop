# Front End Chapter: JavaScript Closures Workshop

## Installation

To get up and running, first install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Workshop Layout

This workshop has three sections:

1. An `AcademicExamples` that we will reference during the presentation
2. An `Examples` folder that contains practical examples and challenges to help you learn.
3. A `playground.ts` file where you can run any code you like with `yarn start`

Within the practical examples, there are 3 workshop. For each workshop, read the instructions from the `.md` file and follow along in the `tutorial.ts` file. Once you've finished the tutorial, try out the accompanying now-your-turn file. There's a test file you can check your solution against to make sure you're on the right path!
